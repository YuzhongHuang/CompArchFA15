The decoder1to32 module produce its output by left shifting the one-bit enable
using operator "<<" by the value of address. 

assign out = enable<<address;

In this line of code, "<<" is the left shift operator. "enable<<address" left 
shift the one-bit enable with the value of address and followed by all "0"s.
Then assign the value of that to a 32-bit bus. 

So if the enable is "0", the output is just a 32-bit "0"s, which will 
not enable any register; if the enable is "1", the output would be 
a 32-bit word with 31 "0"s and one "1" for the register selected, 
since it's shifted by address of the selected register.

The decoder1to32 module produce its output by left shifting the one-bit enable
using operator "<<" by the value of address. So if the enable is "0", 
the output is just a 32-bit "0"s, which will not enable any register; if 
the enable is "1", the output would be a 32-bit word with 31 "0"s and 
one "1" for the register selected, since it's shifted by address of 
the selected register.
